description: >-
  I create modern, on-trend, Indigenous jewelry that's infused with elements of
  my coastal Indigenous culture and identity. I design pieces I want to wear,
  big statement pieces with a deep connection to ancestral strength and
  elegance. 

  I'm inspired by the natural realm, living in the present time, and constantly having to choose every day to honor the Earth. Always, I am also inspired by my family and from within my culture. I come from weavers and beaders, through both my Haíłzaqv and Nuu-chah-nulth families. We have a history of loving beauty and wearing our culture on ourselves that stretches beyond linear timelines.
