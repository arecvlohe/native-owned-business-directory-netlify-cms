  Simpcw First Nations, British Columbia and Mohawk/Scottish descent. We live in
  the Laurentian mountains north of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. For more than a
  decade, we have applied our skills and dedication to building native spiritual
  tools, and sharing on the powwow trail. We have a busy schedule which includes
  drum making, art shows, conferences, and traveling powwows all over North
  America. Through our work, we support the sharing of traditions and teachings
  of Canadaâ€™s tribal peoples.

  Our specialty is our powwow drum, which have become very popular! We are extremely honored to have some of the best upcoming drum groups playing our drums. We build a wide range of hand drum styles and sizes, which can be heard at Round Dances all over Indian Country.
