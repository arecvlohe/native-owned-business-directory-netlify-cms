description: Our mission is to teach the youth the importance of embracing
  culture and history while building a Native American clothing company. We do
  that by crafting Native apparel designs that you can be proud to wear. Modern
  Native American clothing and Native prints that have a deeper meaning. Maybe
  it's a light hearted or funny design. Maybe it's a serious issue that needs to
  be addressed. We use art and streetwear mixed with our culture to create
  one-of-a-kind designs that embrace our Native American culture and heritage.
  Our team is made up of natives from several tribes. We design, print and ship
  everything in house. We are also able to take custom design orders. We can
  create custom apparel, logos, websites, and more.
