  Ginew (Gih-noo) is the first Native American-owned denim collection. This
  family business was founded by Amanda Bruegl – Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee and
  Erik Brodt – Ojibwe. 

  Amanda and Erik are from Wisconsin and currently reside in Portland, Oregon. The couple jointly crafted the first series of belts from their wedding buffalo, which was hunted, prepared, tanned and hand-dyed by them with their families. Ginew's leather goods are made with pre-industrial methods, heirloom leather-working tools, and patterns handed down from generation to generation, since the 1880's. Their leather belts are meticulously crafted using either Horween® or Herman Oak® leathers and finished with some of the finest forged brass buckles.

  Since then, the collection has expanded to include denim, tees, accessories and other goods, with each item they make drawing direct inspiration from their cultures and relatives. Ginew incorporates family symbols and teachings into their garments, while constructing them of the finest American made materials. Selvedge denim, wax canvas, and Pendleton® wool blanket fabric are some of the premium fabrics you’ll find in the collection.
