description: "Urban Native Era (UNE) started in November 2012 in San Jose, CA by
  Joey Montoya (Lipan Apache) who wanted to increase the visibility of
  Indigenous Peoples through social media. He began taking photos and videos of
  the ‘Idle No More’ movement and posted them online. By May 2013, Urban Native
  Era released its first set of shirts intended to draw in a broader audience.
  Today, UNE crafts minimal yet powerful designs to create timeless garments.
  Made for everyone. "
