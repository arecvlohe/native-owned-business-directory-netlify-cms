description: Angel and Alex are the Indigiqueer co-founders of Indi City. In
  2017 they became the first global Indigenous Designers to incorporate wearable
  technology into traditional regalia.  Their first piece a Woman’s Traditional
  outfit called “ The Matriarch Speaks,”  exhibited in Calgary, Ottawa and
  Shenzhen, China.  In the same year they both graduated from the Indigenous
  Women in Community Leadership Program at St.FX University in Antigonish, Nova
  Scotia. Together they design and create fashion accessories according to the
  current indigenization of Turtle Island in contact with their ancestral roots.
  Indi City has grown from a small business on Instagram to a newly launched
  online store with products also found in shops and boutiques across the
  country. With an in-house multi-media productions company they work to curate
  a 100% Indigenous made brand through visual marketing and story-telling.
