  Having not had access to my Indigenous community, language or culture growing
  up, beadwork, alongside my academic work, has become a significant contributor
  to my efforts to reconnect with my community and culture. I am constantly
  learning, growing and connecting in ways that I would have never imagined
  possible.


  Since starting my online business in July 2020, it has been inspiring to connect with others who are beginning their crafting journey or who have been on that path for many years. I love the conversation, the stories, the sharing of knowledge and the new friendships. Beadwork is medicine, and I am humbled by the opportunity to provide people with everything they need to start or continue to do beadwork.
