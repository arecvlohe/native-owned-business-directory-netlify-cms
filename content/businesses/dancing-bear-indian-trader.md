  Dancing Bear Indian Trader was founded in 1990 in Southern California by its
  namesake, “Dancing Bear”, Don Tracy. Don’s first sale was at the Sycuan annual
  powwow in the mountains east of San Diego. He set up a single table and
  offered a selection of Indian craft supplies. Ever since then Dancing Bear
  Indian Trader has been setting up their booth at powwows all throughout
  Southern California, serving the craft and regalia supply needs of the Indian
  community as well as the general public.

  Dancing Bear Indian Trader expanded in 2005 by adding an ecommerce website. In 2008 we opened our first store in Vista, California, Expanded & moved our store to Escondido in 2011.

  At any given powwow, dancers know that if they need an emergency regalia repair, they can always come to DancingBear for a needle and a length of sinew to save the day.
