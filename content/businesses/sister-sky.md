description: The story of Sister Sky begins with two sisters who grew up in a culture that
  has rich and meaningful plant traditions respecting nature’s own healing herbs from Mother
  Earth. Our Native American grandmothers harvested a variety of plants like sweet grass, cedar and sage to make teas, ointments and creams. Embracing the herbal wisdom of their heritage, the sisters enjoyed a weekend hobby of making natural soaps and lotions in their kitchens. Often, they would take those hand made products to local craft shows to sell.
