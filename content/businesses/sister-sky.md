description: The story of Sister Sky begins with two sisters who grew up in a
  culture that has rich and meaningful plant traditions respecting nature’s
  own healing herbs from Mother Earth. Our Native American grandmothers
  harvested a variety of plants like sweet grass, cedar and sage to make teas,
  ointments and creams. Embracing the herbal wisdom of their heritage, the
  sisters enjoyed a weekend hobby of making natural soaps and lotions in their
  kitchens.
